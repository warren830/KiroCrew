"""AgentCore Observatory — read-only control-plane reads, driven by the catalog.

One code path serves all 27 resource types: :func:`list_resource` looks the type
up in :mod:`.catalog` and builds the argv from that row. There is deliberately no
per-type function, because a hand-written function per type is 27 places for a
response key to be wrong and only one of them gets a test.

Every call goes through :func:`kiro_crew.cloud.aws.run_aws`, the ``cloud``
package's single subprocess chokepoint: credentials are resolved by the ``aws``
CLI's own provider chain from the profile name, and the argv is sandbox-wrapped.
Nothing here reads a credential file and nothing here mutates AWS state — the
verbs are ``list-*`` and ``get-*`` only.

**Agent sessions are refused, by design.** The chokepoint's
``assert_chokepoint_allowed`` admits only an explicit ``(service, operation)``
allowlist when ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` is set, and no AgentCore verb is on it.
The gateway process does not carry that variable, so the dashboard's own page
reads fine while an agent that imports this module gets
:class:`~kiro_crew.cloud.aws.CloudActionDenied`. Widening that allowlist is a
deliberate change to a core security surface and is NOT bundled here.

Two failure modes are silent in the underlying API and are therefore reported
explicitly rather than folded into a number:

* **A non-zero CLI exit is not an empty result.** An expired SSO session, a
  missing IAM permission, and an account with zero resources all produce
  "nothing to show" if only stdout is parsed. Each read carries its error text so
  the caller can distinguish "not authorized" from "none deployed" — the
  distinction that decides whether the user fixes credentials or deploys
  something.
* **A truncated page is not a total.** Callers that aggregate must check
  :attr:`ListResult.truncated`, set when the bounded pagination loop stopped with
  a ``nextToken`` still outstanding.
